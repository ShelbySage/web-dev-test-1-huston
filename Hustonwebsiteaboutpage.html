<p>	Rats are extremely smart animals who have gotten a bad rep through history. people tend to view rats as dirty, or sick creatures,<br> but in reality they took the blame for one of historys worst times, eventhough they where not responsible. let me state one more time: Rats did not cause the plaugue, and rats are not dirty.</p>
<p> rats are some of the cleanest animals on earth, cleaner then cats. pet rats even groom their owners to show affection. </p>
